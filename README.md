# Numerical model on banfkfull discharge and channel geometry

Numerical model that describes long-term spatiotemporal evolution of bankfull characteristics of an alluvial meandering river


## Model description

This page provides a numerical model used in a research paper by Naito and Parker, which was submitted to Earth Surface Processes and Landforms in May 2020. It is an implementation of a modeling framework by [Naito & Parker (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JF004971), which was published in Journal of Geophysical Research in September 2019. 
The model describes reach-characteristics spatiotemporal co-evolution of bankfull characteristics (i.e. bankfull dishcarge, bankfull width, bankfull depth and down-channel slope). 

The model is written with Python 2.7. However, it is developed in such a way that it can also be run with PyPy, which is a faster alternative implementation of Python. PyPy can be downloaded at https://pypy.org/. 


### Contents

[Here](./Part1_Base_run) the model, model products as well as a model-input flow duration curve are provided. 
The model is implemented for the case of the Minnesota River near Jordan, MN, USA.
